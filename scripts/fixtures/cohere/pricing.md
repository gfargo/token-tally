Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

*   ##### How do I inquire about model customization and private deployment?

Cohere supports bespoke model customization for our enterprise customers along with private deployment of all our products. Custom pricing is based on your enterprise needs. Learn more about customization [here](https://cohere.com/customization) and private deployment [here](https://cohere.com/private-deployments).    
*   ##### How do I get a Trial API key?

When an account is created, we automatically create an Trial API key for you. This API key will be available on the dashboard for you to copy, as well as in the dashboard section called “API Keys.”    
*   ##### How do I get a Production API key?

To get a Production key, you'll need to have Owner privileges (or ask your organization Owner to complete the following steps). Navigate to the Billing and Usage page in your Cohere dashboard. Click on the Get Your Production key button and fill out the Go to Production workflow.    
*   ##### What’s the difference between a Trial API key and Production API key?

API calls made from a Trial API key are free. However, trial keys are rate limited and are not permitted to be used for production or commercial purposes. API calls made from a Production API key will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis. Production API keys are designed for production use at scale.    
*   ##### Are there any account limitations upon signup?

Every account begins as a personal account and only has access to Trial API keys. As a personal account, you will not be able to add other members until you become part of an organization.    
*   ##### What’s the difference between an organization and a personal account?

At Cohere, an organization is a group of personal accounts that share a singular billing portal. Organizations are not automatically given Production API key access, and a member of the organization must still fill out our application form for production access. Personal accounts cannot share billing information with other accounts.    
*   ##### Which model should I pick?

Your model selection reflects your relative prioritization of model performance and speed. Larger models offer better performance and are capable of more complex tasks, while smaller models have faster response times.    
*   ##### When do I get billed?

API calls made from a Trial API key will be free. API calls made from a Production key will be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Your bill will be issued at the end of every calendar month or when you reach $250 in outstanding balances.    
*   ##### The endpoint I’m using is billed by token. What is a token?

Language models understand “tokens” rather than characters or bytes. The number of tokens per word depends on the complexity of the text. Simple text may approach 1 token per word on average, while complex texts may use less common words that require 3-4 tokens per word on average. For more details on tokens, refer to [this page](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tokens-and-tokenizers).    
*   
##### Where do I find pricing for our legacy models?

For existing customers:

    *   Command pricing is $1.00/1M tokens for input and $2.00/1M tokens for output
    *   Command-light pricing is $0.30/1M tokens for input and $0.60/1M tokens for output
    *   Command R 03-2024 pricing is $0.50/1M tokens for input and $1.50/1M tokens for output
    *   Command R+ 04-2024 pricing is $3.00/1M tokens for input and $15.00/1M tokens for output

Command R+ 08-2024 pricing is $2.50/1M tokens for input and $10.00/1M tokens for output

*   ##### What is the cost for accessing the research Aya models via the API?

Aya Expanse models (8B and 32B) on the API are charged at $0.50/1M tokens for input and $1.50/1M tokens for output. Find more information about the Aya models [here](https://cohere.com/research/aya).
